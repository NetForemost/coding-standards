# 📘 Pull Request Guidelines  
## React + TypeScript + .NET Projects

These guidelines exist to keep the codebase clean, predictable, and maintainable.

They also help speed up PR reviews and reduce unnecessary back-and-forth.

> [!NOTE] 
> If your PR does not follow these rules, it will be requested for changes.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

Before opening a PR, always ask yourself:

- Does this change only what my task requires?
- Did I follow existing patterns?
- Did I understand the code I wrote?
- Would another developer understand this PR in 6 months?

If the answer is no, fix it before opening the PR.

## ✅ PR Scope Rules (VERY IMPORTANT)

### A PR must:

- Contain only changes related to the assigned feature or fix
- Follow existing architecture and patterns
- Be minimal and focused

### A PR must NOT:

- Include unrelated refactors
- Modify random files because formatting changed
- Add or remove imports that are not required
- Add whitespace-only changes
- Reformat files unless explicitly requested
- Introduce files in new folders without approval

If you think something else needs fixing:

- Open another ticket
- Ask first

## 🧠 Think Before You Code (Especially With AI)

Using ChatGPT / Copilot / Gemini / Other is allowed.

Blind copy-paste is NOT.

You are expected to:

- Understand what every line does
- Be able to explain your code
- Validate types and logic
- Adapt output to project patterns

If you submit AI-generated code without reviewing it, your PR will be rejected.

## 📐 Follow Existing Design Patterns

Do not invent new patterns.

Example:

If the project uses:

```ts
interface User {
  id: string;
}
```

Do NOT introduce:

```ts
type User = {
  id: string;
}
```

Consistency is more important than personal preference.

This applies to:

- Folder structure
- Naming
- Services
- Hooks
- Controllers
- DTOs
- Domain models

Always mirror existing implementations.

## 🟦 TypeScript + React Standards
### 🚫 Avoid any

`any` removes type safety.

Bad:

```ts
const data: any = response.data;
```

Better:

```ts
interface ApiResponse {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}

const data: ApiResponse = response.data;
```

If unsure:

```rs
type ApiResponse = {
  id: string;
} | null;
```

Union types are preferred over `any`.

## ✅ Always Prefer Explicit Types

Props:

```ts
interface Props {
  title: string;
}
```

or (depending on the current project patten)

```ts
type Props {
    title: string;
}
```

State:

```ts
const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0);
```

Callbacks:

```ts
const handleClick = (id: string): void => {}
```

### 🚫 No Unused Imports

Remove unused imports immediately.

If your PR contains unused imports, it will be rejected.

### 🚫 No Console Logs

Remove all console logs before committing.

### 🚫 No Commented Code

Bad:

```
// old logic
// const x = ...
```

Delete it.

Git already keeps history.

> [!NOTE] 
> Good comments are **context comments**. E.g. trying to explain why something was done in a specific way. Comments should not explain the code but provide business logic context if necessary.

Good:

```
// The business requires us to save browser data for audit purposes, that's why wo do this
```

## 🟥 Backend (.NET) Standards
### Follow Existing Architecture

Do NOT:
- Create random services
- Skip layers
- Bypass DTOs
- Return EF entities directly

Respect:
- Controllers
- Services
- Repositories
- Domain models

### No Magic Values 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> (This applies to both front, back and any other app layer)

Bad:

```c#
if(status == 3)
```

Good:

```c#
if(status == OrderStatus.Completed)
```

### Use Strong Types

Avoid:
```c#
object result
```

Prefer:
```c#
OrderDto result
```

## ‼️❌ REGEX 

Unless strictly necessary, don´t use regex in the code.

Regex functionalities for comparing strings tend to grow in terms of usage and when you see it, the function using regex is being used everywhere but what a surprise, nobody knows how the regex works anymore. 

Everytime you start typing a regex in the code make this question to yourself, can this be done in a simpler way? Can this be done using simple string operations?

> (This applies to both front, back and any other app layer)

## 📁 File Placement Rules

Do not create files in new folders unless explicitly approved.

Always mirror existing structure.

If unsure, ask first.

## 🧪 Testing

Every PR must clearly state:
- What was tested
- How it was tested

Example:

```md
Tested:
- Created order manually
- Verified UI render
- Validated API response
```

### 📝 PR Description Template

Use this format:

#### What
Short description of change.

---

#### Why
Business or technical reason.

---

#### How
High-level approach.

---

#### Tested
Steps performed.

---
#### Notes (optional)
Anything reviewers should know.

### 🚨 Automatic Rejection Reasons

PR will be rejected if it contains:
- any
- unrelated changes
- commented code
- unused imports
- random formatting
- new folders without approval
- AI copy-paste without understanding
- missing PR description
- missing testing info

No exceptions.

### 🧭 Final Rule

If something is unclear:

ASK.

Guessing costs more time than asking.

### ✅ Goal

- Clean PRs
- Predictable architecture
- Fast reviews

- Strong engineers
